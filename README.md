# Isomorphic Portfolio using React

An isomorphic portfolio website rendered on the server for initial load. Built using react to render the views. Wanted a way to showcase my projects in an interesting way.

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/oandrienko/isomorphic-portfolio
cd isomorphic-portfolio
npm install
```

To start the server:

```
npm run start
```

## Built With

* Node and Express for server
* React for composing views
* React Router for client-end navigation

## Tools Used

* Webpack for module bundling, lazy-loader, chunk splitting and webpack-dev-server for initial build and HMR functionality
* Babel for transpiling ES6 for server and client
* Nodemon utility for use during server-side development

## TODO

*Remove JQuery dependancy. Mostly used for animations
*Move projects to a database
*Add loading screens inbetween transitions
*Clean up code
*Lazy load Project and About components
