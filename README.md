# Isomorphic Portfolio using React

An isomorphic portfolio website rendered on the server for initial load. Built using react to render the views. Wanted a way to showcase my projects in an interesting way.


### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/oandrienko/isomorphic-portfolio
cd isomorphic-portfolio
npm install
```


## Built With

* Node and Express for server
* React for composing views
* React Router for client-end navigation


## Tools Used

* Webpack for module bundeling, and webpack-dev-server for initial build and HMR functionality
* Babel for transpiling ES6 for server and client
* Nodemon utility for use during server-side development


## Acknowledgments

* Giampaolo Bellavite for the inspiration to do this after seeing his [isomorphic500](https://github.com/gpbl/isomorphic500) project.
